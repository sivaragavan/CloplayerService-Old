<p>The easiest example of this, and the one that everyone uses as the .Apple sucks at social. whipping boy is the iTunes-powered Ping. It seems like out of the 25 people I follow, only MC Hammer is actually engaging with the product. Hard core Apple fanboys defend Ping.s failure (and it is an <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/scott/ping-fail-5-reasons-to-avoid-joining-apples-soci">uncontested failure</a>) on its lack of Facebook integration, which Facebook pulled because of negotiation issues.</p>
<p>Because Apple.s best attempts at social have been integrations with other services, Facebook in iPhoto, and Twitter in iOS 5, let.s leave Ping alone for now. Who knows, maybe it would have worked out if Facebook had been involved?</p>
<p>Instead, let.s talk about .<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/find-my-friends/id466122094?mt=8">Find My Friends</a>,. an app that came out of iOS 5 in October. Quite honestly this should be called .Find My Kids,. as most of the people reviewing it in the App Store are people describing this use case.</p>
<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screen-shot-2011-11-27-at-7-34-40-pm.jpg" rel="lightbox[458518]"></a></p>
<p>In almost two months since its launch, I.ve only had one friend ask to follow me on it, and I think that was a joke . I.m too embarrassed to ask any of my friends to follow them on it, and I can.t even think any reason to, actually.</p>
<p>I.m even hearing that people at Apple have been making fun of it internally. &#8212; Turns out no one really wants to Find Their Friends. Kids maybe, but you can just text your friends to find out where they are if they and you are an adult.  Reminds me of another useless social product from another company that doesn.t get it, Google Latitude.</p>
<p>Pro tip: If your friends are lying to you about where they are, then they.re not your friends.</p>
<p>It strikes me that everyone picks on Google.s social awkwardness, but not Apple.s. Sure you can argue that Apple makes social hardware not software, but iOS 5 features like iMessage (which has some <a href="http://mgalligan.com/post/13214024991/apple-imessage-and-poor-user-experiences">user experience issues of its own</a>) imply the grand possibilities of what happens if Apple somehow gets this kind of stuff right . namely no more $30 monthly SMS fees or endless launches of social photo sharing apps.</p>
<p><strong>(Apple should just suck it up and buy Instagram, much like Google should just buy Twitter.)</strong></p>
<p>The reason this is important now more than ever, is that Apple.s social stumbles are giving companies like Facebook the confidence and chutzpah to <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20111122/the-facebook-phone-the-slayer-wasnt/">get into the mobile space</a>, efforts that will inevitably chip away at Apple market share if executed correctly.</p>

The bad news is that they&#8217;ve replaced it with another unfortunately left-aligned image of some random guy (Wikipedia programmer <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=L11_1124_NL_PFP/en/US&amp;utm_source=B11_1124_branGbr&amp;utm_medium=sitenotice&amp;utm_campaign=C11_1124_GCvPFP_US&amp;language=en&amp;uselang=en&amp;country=US&amp;referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHarley_davidson">Brandon Harris </a>to be precise) who, according to my email inbox, looks like everything from Jesus, to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelback">Nickelback</a> lead singer Chad Kroeger to a member of the Hell&#8217;s Angels.</p>
<p>And because Harris&#8217; image is left aligned, the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/20/ligers-and-tigons-and-wales-oh-my/">weird article title/image juxtaposition</a> thing still stands; The last straw was when I was Wikipedia-ing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Keaton">actress Diane Keaton</a> last night and up he came, inadvertently wearing the same outfit and in the same pose as the <em>Annie Hall</em> star.</p>
<p>Here is a particularly hilarious conversation I had about it with somebody on IM.</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> damn some idiot biker is screaming at me to give me money today <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra</a><br />
<strong>Person:</strong> refresh the page<br />
<strong>Person:</strong> he should ride in on a harley<br />
<strong>Person:</strong> and then jack me with a switchblade<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Snort<br />
<strong>Person:</strong> cut my face if i don&#8217;t drop some funds on wikipedia<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Should I do <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/20/ligers-and-tigons-and-wales-oh-my/">another post?</a><br />
<strong>Person:</strong> I&#8217;ve heard Jesus<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> seems necessary<br />
<strong>Person:</strong> Is wikipedia run by a biker gang?<br />
<strong>Person:</strong> Will they slit your tires if you don&#8217;t donate?<br />
<strong>Person:</strong> i like how he has two different pics<br />
<strong>Person:</strong> there&#8217;s the soft outside guy silently judging you and the intimidating dude who will jack your ass</p>
<p>&#8220;I donated to get Brandon Harris&#8217; picture off the top. I didn&#8217;t mind Jimmy Wales&#8217; piercing gaze but Brandon was just disturbing,&#8221; notes interaction designer Xianhang Zhang <a href="http://www.quora.com/Do-some-people-donate-to-Wikipedia-just-to-get-Jimmy-Wales-picture-off-the-top">on Quora</a>. Until Wikipedia finally figures it out, Jimmy Wales himself <a href="http://www.quora.com/Do-some-people-donate-to-Wikipedia-just-to-get-Jimmy-Wales-picture-off-the-top">offers an </a>alternative to donating (and complaining) for those of you still creeped out,&#8221;You can also just click the little &#8216;x&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>To donate money to Wikipedia, WHICH YOU TOTALLY SHOULD IN CASE IT&#8217;S NOT CLEAR, <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=L11_1124_NL_PFP/en/US&amp;utm_source=B11_1124_branGbr&amp;utm_medium=sitenotice&amp;utm_campaign=C11_1124_GCvPFP_US&amp;language=en&amp;uselang=en&amp;country=US&amp;referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHarley_davidson">follow this link.</a></p>

ComScore is <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2011/11/Black_Friday_Boasts_816_Million_in_U.S._Online_Holiday_Spending">announcing</a> even stronger results for e-commerce, with Black Friday seeing $816 million in online sales, making it the heaviest online spending day to date in 2011 and representing a 26 percent increase versus Black Friday 2010 ($648 million spent).

That's an impressive jump considering the 2009 to 2010 increase in Black Friday spending was only 9 percent. Thanksgiving Day saw an 18 percent increase in online spending to $479 million. U.S. consumers have spent $12.7 billion already in the first 25 days of the November to December 2011 holiday season, up 15 percent from the corresponding days last year.

ComScore is <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2011/11/Black_Friday_Boasts_816_Million_in_U.S._Online_Holiday_Spending">announcing</a> even stronger results for e-commerce, with Black Friday seeing $816 million in online sales, making it the heaviest online spending day to date in 2011 and representing a 26 percent increase versus Black Friday 2010 ($648 million spent).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an impressive jump considering the 2009 to 2010 increase in Black Friday spending was only 9 percent. Thanksgiving Day saw an 18 percent increase in online spending to $479 million. U.S. consumers have spent $12.7 billion already in the first 25 days of the November to December 2011 holiday season, up 15 percent from the corresponding days last year.</p>
<p>comScore says fifty million Americans visited online retail sites on Black Friday, which is an increase of 35 percent versus year ago. Each of the top five retail sites achieved double-digit gains in visitors vs. last year, led by Amazon. Walmart ranked second, followed by Best Buy, Target and Apple.</p>
<p>Experian Hitwise also reported similar traffic results, revealing that US total visits to the top 500 retail sites increased 2% on Black Friday 2011 compared to 2010. Amazon was the top retail site receiving traffic on Black Friday for the 7th year in a row, followed by Wal-mart and Best Buy, respectively.</p>
<p>Consumers were also increasingly looking online for information about offline and web-based Black Friday deals. For example, Black Friday deals site bfads.net saw 3.9 million unique visitors, up 51 percent versus last year. TheBlackFriday.com followed with 3.2 million visitors, up 137 percent from last year.</p>
<p>Of course, Cyber Monday is tomorrow and it could be the peak day for the entire holiday shopping season. Last year, Cyber Monday was the heaviest day of online spending ever, with sales exceeding <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/01/record-breaking-cyber-monday-surpasses-1-billion-in-u-s-online-spending/">$1 billion</a>. Considering <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/23/comscore-u-s-online-holiday-shopping-already-up-14-percent-to-9-7-billion/">the peaks we are already seeing</a> with online spending this season, tomorrow could bring record sales for e-retailers.</p>

When you speak to someone you see frequently, you probably respond to the same questions with close-up, specific descriptions of your activities over past few days. Humans are aware of when and what we last communicated with someone, and we dynamically alter what information we provide to avoid repetition.

While most of the discussion about <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/20/facebook-news-feed-gets-smarter%E2%80%94%C2%A0and-the-ticker-makes-its-big-debut/">Facebook's latest changes</a> has centered around the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/19/curation-through-unsharing/">real-time Ticker</a>, the switch to a news feed that displays different content depending on when you last visited will also profoundly change how we use the social network.

When you speak to someone you see frequently, you probably respond to the same questions with close-up, specific descriptions of your activities over past few days. Humans are aware of when and what we last communicated with someone, and we dynamically alter what information we provide to avoid repetition.</p>
<p>While most of the discussion about <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/20/facebook-news-feed-gets-smarter%E2%80%94%C2%A0and-the-ticker-makes-its-big-debut/">Facebook&#8217;s latest changes</a> has centered around the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/19/curation-through-unsharing/">real-time Ticker</a>, the switch to a news feed that displays different content depending on when you last visited will also profoundly change how we use the social network. Eventually, I think the &#8220;return visit-aware&#8221; concept will also change how we consume content across the web.</p>
<p>Before the switch, Facebook was struggling with repetitive content and a user base that engages with the site in very different ways. Frequent visitors &#8212; those returning multiple times a day &#8212; would often see the same stories first on the default Top News feed. Some wouldn&#8217;t go to the trouble, while others didn&#8217;t even realize they could switch to the Most Recent tab to see what had just been published. This led them to feel that Facebook was stale and caused them to quickly navigate away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those who visited once or twice a week would only see the the most Liked, commented on, and clicked stories of the last few hours or day, leading them to miss highly relevant stories that happened a few days ago. This made it seem like nothing really interesting was happening on Facebook and that there was no reason to stop by more frequently. These interactions didn&#8217;t mimic the tradition of human communication. With the single-tabbed return visit-aware news feed, Facebook has solved all these problems by aligning its interface with natural human habits.</p>
<p>The Top News and Most Recent tabs have been combined into a single one, shifting the initial burden of choice from the user to Facebook. This works because a human typically doesn&#8217;t ask someone &#8220;Tell me what&#8217;s happened to you in the last [78 hours or 35 minutes]?&#8221; The respondent simply knows when they last spoke and tailors their transmission appropriately.</p>
<p>When you vist, the news feed surfaces the most relevant stories from between then and your last visit. If it&#8217;s been a week since your last visit, it shows only the biggest stories from that timespan, making sure you don&#8217;t miss anything important. This mimics how friends who&#8217;ve been out of touch for months communicate when reunited.</p>
<p>If you visited a few hours ago, it will show you the most relevant stories from those hours, but also a &#8220;25 more recent stories&#8221; link at the top. Similarly, if you&#8217;ve spent a day apart from someone, you might tell them the most significant news of the day, but also about your current mood.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve visited the Facebook home page multiple times that day, it shows you the latest updates so there&#8217;s something fresh to see. Similarly, after working together all day and discussing bigger news, but then taking a lunch break apart, two coworkers might discuss in person who they had lunch with. Otherwise, this information might seem inconsequential like the minutiae the news feed shows if you constantly check it. But since all other information has already been discussed, the very recent becomes relevant.</p>
<p>By marking and unmarking stories as &#8220;highlighted&#8221; using the blue corners in the interface, you can teach Facebook&#8217;s EdgeRank news feed ordering algorithm your preferences. This mirrors how you can interrupt a friend&#8217;s boring story and ask about something else, or ask follow up questions about a topic such that they bring up that topic more in the future.</p>
<p>The end result is a news feed that usually shows interesting content. This inspires longer session times; more return visits; and more Likes, comments, and shares on news feed stories that trigger notifications or create content that pulls in other users.</p>
<h3>Return Visit-Aware Content Streams For The Rest Of The Web</h3>
<p>Sites and services around the web are seeking these same benefits, and therefore I believe they&#8217;ll look to develop their own versions of consumption-sensitive content streams. Right now, most news sites try to approximate this by featuring the most important content of the last day or so, and rearranging and demoting top stories as they grow older. <a href="http://techmeme.com/">Techmeme</a> is probably the best example of this, but still they all essentially operate on the premise that you visit every 12 to 18 hours. Vist less frequently than that, and a must-read piece of news may have slipped down and off the home page. </p>
<p>Last week I reviewed an iOS app called the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/16/riversip-tech-reader/">Riversip Tech Reader</a>. It tackles the problem by letting users toggle between viewing the latest news, top news of the day, or the biggest stories of the week. This is probably the easiest solution and it doesn&#8217;t depend on tracking a user&#8217;s previous actions. It also works for streams which don&#8217;t require click-throughs to expand individual pieces of content. However, it does place the burden of choice on the user. Twitter or some Twitter app could try this, surfacing the stories with the most retweets from a given time period.</p>
<p>An approach for when users must take an action such as clicking through to consume content is to remove, demote, or set aside content a user has already viewed. Imagine if the CNN home page replaced tiles or headlines of any story you&#8217;ve already read with something you haven&#8217;t. This could possibly be done through cookies or another tracking scheme, but it would presumably be more accurate if a user was logged in.</p>
<p>Sites services, and apps with login functionality or another way to tie actions to identity should be considering how they can make their content displays truly sensitive to when a user last visited without explicit input. Using its login and other social plugins, Facebook may even seek to power this shift of other sites. In either case, the content relevancy arms race is on. The same way newspapers look hopelessly static next to Techmeme will be the way the sites of today will look next to the personalized, return visit-aware sites of tomorrow.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/goingshopping.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="goingshopping" title="goingshopping" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>With all these amazing tools we have, it&#8217;s not a little surprising how much we take the traditional forms of media as the way things are and should be done. The iPad exposes the mediocrity of our expectations, with its Reader button in the address field stripping the comments and jingle jangle out and letting us focus on the simple post as form. Get in, state the premise, survive the middle, get out.</p>
<p>I remember the days of Hunter S. Thompson, the free range lunatic who stepped up where Kurt Vonnegut and Tom Wolfe had not feared to tread. It was always a mystery he uncorked, starting with the possibility that he wouldn&#8217;t even file a story at all. The rhythm was in the gasps between paragraphs, those stolen breaths taken that functioned as cymbals compressed in high hat swirls.</p>
<p>How grateful we were for the next issue of Rolling Stone, with the crazy drawings, the ridiculous dashes on the open road, the fearless unmasking of the hypocrisy of the time. Exhilarating doesn&#8217;t even come close to the feeling he commandeered in a string of features that defined the turbulence of the times as something funnier, darker, elastic, and even perhaps ultimately pointless. Even that last was part of the rush. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t pretend to understand how he got there or how brave and foolish he was to try. The shimmer of that arc has never been something you could package or survive, it seems. But what is sure is that we live surrounded and enveloped in the existence of those gasps of fresh air, and that it is a choice we make to ignore them.</p>
<p>Thinking ahead to what I look forward to, I remind myself that even in the language of the times, the poetry of the words always meant more than the ideals. Freedom was a rallying cry, but the actual cry took freedom for granted and went further. Freedom to do what? It wasn&#8217;t about the right to do something, it was about what the something was to do. Escaping gravity to do what?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a moment in East-West, the seminal Paul Butterfield Blues Band record, where an early crescendo releases into a stunning guitar exploration by Mike Bloomfield. It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re suddenly propelled floating into space, on a journey you thought you might be in for but had no way of being sure of. And as it again builds into a frenzy and pulls that same trigger yet again, you realize how this place exists right there in front of you, waiting for that moment to reappear ever so slightly different.</p>
<p>The next song, can you believe there even is a next song? &#8220;I got a mind to give up living/ Yes and go shopping instead.&#8221; The blues with a steely glint of comedy, you say? What kind of alchemy is possible that springs from the celebration of loss, destruction, death . and that&#8217;s just before the opening credits. And remember: it&#8217;s sitting right there next to you with that insane grin on its face.</p>
<p>Something about the juxtaposition of things reminds me of the politics of disruption, the emotional spring of the social generation. By themselves, interesting, intellectual perhaps, but not of the parallel land of hope and acceptance. I read an interview with Noel Gallagher, the supposedly sane one of the Oasis brothers. Something about Oasis being in the Top 10 of bands. He ducked the statement briefly, attributing it to alcohol and passing it off as Top 20 straight.</p>
<p>But then he owned it anyway and listed the groups: &#8220;(T)he Beatles, the Sex Pistols, the Rolling Stones, the Who. I can never remember 5. Maybe the Kinks. I can.t remember 6, then Oasis.&#8221; Well, allright. It&#8217;s a stretch for me, but I can&#8217;t remember 5 or 6 either. The strange part is, I can see where the guy is coming from. And it doesn&#8217;t matter whether he&#8217;s right or not, just that he sees something just over there.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care how noisy the stream is. The more the better, actually. Until it gets so useless someone comes along and hops alongside it and surfs it, like a wave building as it nears the shore. It&#8217;s not that there&#8217;s necessarily some huge revelation just around the next tweet. It&#8217;s that there are wonderful souls and achingly precious children and silly love songs and the best breakfast place around and a roar of ideas and jockeying for position and routine power grabs and whatnot.</p>
<p>So here are my Top Ten predictions. the iPad, push notification, Chatter external groups,  the Cloud, AirPlay Mirroring, Spotify, @mentions, and I can&#8217;t remember 5 or 6 either. Gillmor Gang is 7. </p>

It&#8217;s telling that even the lowered price still seems ridiculously high, considering that smaller but more advanced models are selling for under $100. How long can this outlier live in a world dominated by cheap, pocketable, touchscreen <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/e-readers/">e-readers</a>?</p>
<p>In its current form, the fact is it&#8217;s likely on its way out. The Kindle Keyboard and indeed the graphite look in general are on their way out, to be replaced by the lighter, thinner, more touchable new generation. But there&#8217;s a problem: the DX is one of the very few e-readers that doesn&#8217;t use the same 6&#8243; E-Ink screen as everyone else. Amazon probably knows there&#8217;s demand there, but perhaps the time is not yet right to strike.</p>
<p>As you no doubt remember, the Fire was rumored even before its release to be the first of two or more tablets; the next one is supposed to have a larger screen. Makes sense. Amazon wanted to test the waters, and the 7&#8243; tablet was a much easier way to do that. The popularity of the tablet (despite a lukewarm critical reception) doesn&#8217;t guarantee a larger version, but I think Amazon would be fools not to do it.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with the DX? As long as they&#8217;re unveiling one big e-reader, why not two? Okay, that&#8217;s not very convincing. But the DX is a fish out of water right now, and it needs to be either replaced or put out to pasture. I think Amazon is going to keep the large e-reader as a premium option, but it needs more time to engineer it. Who knows, maybe they&#8217;re waiting on the next set of screens from E-Ink.</p>
<p>If I had to prophesy, I&#8217;d expect a late-summer event with a bigger Fire (the &#8220;Flame&#8221; maybe?) and a bigger, improved DX, and depending on E-Ink, perhaps an improved screen. By that time, remember, the high-res iPad 3 will supposedly be out, as will a few other high-res tablets that will offer a superior reading experience owing to their superior displays, LCD as they may be.</p>
<p>Personally, I can&#8217;t wait for a decent large-screen e-reader. These little ones are frustrating and it saddens me to see the leaders of the e-reader industry putting out products that are scarcely distinguishable from one another.</p>

Others spent it trying to get <em>just</em> drunk enough that their relative&#8217;s worst habits were bearable.</p>
<p>A select few, however, spent the weekend doing something pretty much only they can do: hacking the heck out of the iPhone. As a result, everyone waitin&#8217; and wishin&#8217; for an iPhone 4S carrier unlock has something to be thankful for.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not quite a done deal just yet, but iPhone Dev-Team star <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/MuscleNerd">MuscleNerd</a> tweeted out that a &#8220;promising 4S unlock&#8221; had been discovered after a bit of Turkey-fueled hacking.</p>
<p>Oddly, his tweet goes on to confirm that this unlock works <em>only</em> with the 4S (and not the iPhone 4), suggesting that it relies on a hardware-level exploit that went overlooked during the 4S&#8217; creation. While such exploits are increasingly rare, they&#8217;re also considerably more challenging for Apple to patch post-manufacturing.</p>

Despite a shaky economy, many web companies are in hypergrowth.

One challenge, which isn.t new, is the battle for consumer attention.  If you.re looking to grow your user base, is there a best way to cost-effectively attract valuable users?

<p>As I.ve written about <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/20/why-women-rule-the-internet/">before</a>, we.re in an amazing period of the consumer Internet.  Despite a shaky economy, many web companies are in hypergrowth.  This is reminiscent of the five-year period over a decade ago when companies like Amazon, Netscape, eBay, Yahoo, Google and PayPal were built.</p>
<p>One challenge, which isn.t new, is the battle for consumer attention.  If you.re looking to grow your user base, is there a best way to cost-effectively attract valuable users?  I.m increasingly convinced the best way is by harnessing a concept called social proof, a relatively untapped gold mine in the age of the social web.</p>
<p>What is social proof?  Put simply, it.s the positive influence created when someone finds out that others are doing something.  It.s also known as informational social influence.</p>
<p>Wikipedia describes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof">social proof</a> as .a psychological phenomenon where people assume the actions of others reflect the correct behavior for a given situation. driven by the assumption that the surrounding people possess more information about the situation.. In other words, people are wired to learn from the actions of others, and this can be a huge driver of consumer behavior.</p>
<p>Consider the social proof of a line of people standing behind a velvet rope, waiting to get into a club.  The line makes most people walking by want to find out what.s worth the wait.  The digital equivalent of the velvet rope helped build viral growth for initially invite-only launches like Gmail, Gilt Groupe, Spotify, and Turntable.fm.</p>
<p>Professor <a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=1762">Robert Cialdini</a>, a thought leader in social psychology, has many examples. In one study, his team tested messages to influence reusing towels in hotel rooms.  The social proof message &#8211; <em>.</em><em>Almost 75% of other guests help by using their towels more than once. had 25% better results than all other messages.  And adding the words .of other guests</em><em> </em><em>that stayed in this room. had even more impact (also an example of how A/B testing of small details matters). </em></p>
<p>In another study, a restaurant increased sales of specific dishes by <a href="mailto:http://economics.sas.upenn.edu/~hfang/publication/observationallearning/dukenews.pdf">13-20%</a><em> </em><em>just by highlighting them as .our most popular items..  SP also works on your </em>subconscious . it.s the reason why comedy shows often use a laugh track or audience; people actually laugh more when they can <a href="http://web.mit.edu/~dsmit/laugh-bib/laugh2.pdf">hear other people laughing</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Five Types of Social Proof </span></strong></p>
<p>If you.re a digital startup, building and highlighting your social proof is the best way for new users to learn about you.  And engineering your product to generate social proof, and to be shared through social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, YouTube, Pinterest and others, can multiply the discovery of your product and its influence.  Think of it as building the foundation for massively scalable word-of-mouth.  Here.s a .teardown. on various forms of social proof, and how some savvy digital companies are starting to measure its impact.</p>
<p><strong>1) Expert social proof</strong> . Approval from a credible expert, like a magazine or blogger, can have incredible digital influence.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visitors referred by a fashion magazine or blogger to designer fashion rentals online at <strong><a href="http://www.renttherunway.com/">Rent the Runway</a></strong> drive a 200% higher conversion rate than visitors driven by paid search.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://kcdn3.klout.com/static/images/docs/onesheets/audi.pdf">Klout</a></strong> identifies people who are topical experts on the social web. Klout invited 217 influencers with high Klout scores in design, luxury, tech and autos to test-drive the new Audi A8.  These influencers sparked 3,500 tweets, reaching over 3.1 million people in less than 30 days . a multiplier effect of over 14,000x.</li>
<li>Mom-commerce daily offer site <strong><a href="http://www.plumdistrict.com/">Plum District</a></strong> also reached mom influencers thru Klout, and found customers referred by influential digital moms shop at 2x the rate of customers from all other marketing channels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2) Celebrity social proof </strong>. Up to <a href="http://desn310.wikispaces.com/file/view/CelebrityEndrosementModels_01.pdf">25%</a> of U.S. TV commercials have used celebrities to great effect, but only a handful of web startups have to date.  Some results:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1997, Priceline.com was one of the first web startups to use a celebrity endorser &#8211; <strong>William Shatner</strong> . not a travel expert, but seemingly obsessed with saving consumers money.  It has been a huge win; Priceline now has a $23 billion market cap, and the fee Shatner took in shares is estimated to be worth <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/7683943/William-Shatner-earns-600m-from-Priceline-adverts.html">$600 million.</a></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.trendyol.com/">Trendyol</a></strong>, the fastest-growing fashion ecommerce company in Turkey, regularly launches merchandise campaigns with the endorsement of celebrities. This practice increases site traffic by 2.5x and product sell-through by 30%.</li>
<li><strong>ShoeDazzle</strong> launched with celebrity Kim Kardashian as chief stylist. Her involvement helped leapfrog the company to an estimated $25m in 2010 and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/07/06/shoedazzle-kim-kardashian-ecommerce_n_888260.html">$70 million</a> in 2011 sales, plus a recent $40m financing.  Celebrity endorsement by Jessica Simpson and aesthetician Nerida Joy recently helped <strong>Beautymint</strong> attract 500,000 visitors in the first<em> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/02/beachmints-new-vertical-beautymint-gets-500000-visitors-in-24-hours-thanks-to-jessica-simpson/">24 hours</a></em> of its launch.</li>
<li>The most authentic (and cost-effective) celebrity social proof is unpaid. For<strong> </strong>home dér site <strong><a href="https://www.onekingslane.com/">One Kings Lane</a></strong>, a 2010 unpaid mention in<strong> Gwyneth Paltrow.s</strong> influential blog <a href="http://www.goop.com/">GOOP</a> provided a 90% lift in daily sign-ups vs. the previous 4 days. average.  Celebrity use on<strong> <a href="http://turntable.fm/">Turntable.fm</a></strong> by Sir Mix-A-Lot and producer<strong> </strong>Diplo generated viral buzz, helping the company skyrocket to <a href="http://www.betabeat.com/2011/06/22/how-many-users-does-turntable-fm-have-2011-06-22/">140,000</a> active users in just 4 weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3) User social proof  .</strong> Direct TV marketers are masters at sharing user success stories. (fascination with this was actually the inspiration for this blog post).  Companies mastering this digitally include:<strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More than 61 million people visit <strong>Yelp</strong> (working on an <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/yelp-files-for-i-p-o/">upcoming IPO</a>) each month to read user reviews.  And reviews drive revenue; a recent HBS study showed that a 1-star increase in Yelp rating leads to <a href="http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/67460062"><strong>5-9%</strong></a><strong> </strong>growth in sales.<strong></strong></li>
<li>User-generated videos (UGVs) are a growing and important social proof phenomenon.  Early visitors to Shoedazzle watched more than 9 UGVs on average, helping catapult sales; and user testimonials on YouTube drove a 3x conversion rate vs. organic visitors for Beachbody, the makers of P90x fitness.<strong></strong></li>
<li>Negative user social proof is also important to track. The first negative user review on <strong>eBay</strong> has been shown to reverse a seller.s weekly growth rate from <a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~lcabral/workingpapers/CabralHortacsu_Aug08.pdf">5% to -8%</a>. It also hurts pricing; a 1% increase in negative feedback has been shown to lead to a 7.5% decrease in sale price realized.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4) Wisdom of the crowds social proof </strong>. Ray Kroc started using social proof in <a href="http://overhowmanybillionserved.blogspot.com/">1955</a> by hanging an .Over 1 Million Served. sign at the first McDonald.s.  Highlighting popularity or large numbers of users implies .a million people can.t be wrong..  Some digital examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fashion e-tailer <a href="http://www.modcloth.com/"><strong>Modcloth</strong></a><strong> </strong>enables its community to .Be the Buyer. by voting on which styles they think Modcloth should sell in the future.  Shoppers take strong cues from the community; styles with the .Be the Buyer. badge sell at 2x the velocity of un-badged styles.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.callaway.com/"><strong>Callaway Digital Arts</strong></a> finds that when any of their kids. iPad apps is listed as a top 10 most popular app in the iTunes App Store .Top Charts,. daily downloads vault 10x over the prior week &#8211; but being the No. 1 most popular app drives 30-50% more daily downloads than being No. 2.</li>
<li><em>Greentech company </em><a href="http://opower.com/"><strong>Opower</strong></a><em> uses social proof to help reduce electricity consumption. </em>It works: Opower sees an 80% response rate to e-mails citing how a household<em>.s use compares with the </em>neighborhood, which has driven more than 500 million kilowatt hours of savings so far.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5) Wisdom of your friends social proof . </strong>Learning from friends thru the social web is likely the killer app of social proof in terms of 1:1 impact, and the potential to grow virally.  Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Friends inviting friends to play through Facebook and other social networks helped <strong>Zynga</strong> grow from <a href="mailto:http://techcrunch.com/2008/07/22/zynga-raises-29-million-b-round-led-by-kleiner-perkins-and-buys-virtual-world-facebook-app-yoville/">3 million</a> to <a href="http://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=58262">41 million</a> average <em>daily </em>users in just one year, from 2008 to 2009.</li>
<li>Moms, arguably the most valuable demographic on the social web, rely heavily on friends and family recommendations.  A recent <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/100_press-release-21st-century-mom-shopping_10359432.bc">Babycenter</a> study showed moms rely on the wisdom of their friends 67% more than average shoppers; and they rely on social media 243% more than the general population.</li>
<li>Friends referred by friends make better customers.  They spend more (a 2x higher estimated lifetime value than customers from all other channels at <strong>One Kings Lane</strong>); convert better (75% higher conversion than renters from other marketing channels at <strong>Rent the Runway</strong>); and shop faster (they make their first purchase after joining twice as quickly than referrals from other channels at <strong>Trendyol</strong>)</li>
<li>They also make better contributors.  People who see content from their friends on <strong><a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/">TripAdvisor</a></strong> contribute personal content to the site at 2x the rate of others, and are 20% more engaged than other users.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Building Your Social Proof </strong></p>
<p>Will one form of social proof work best for your company? Maybe, but companies like <strong><a href="http://www.legalzoom.com/index1v.html">LegalZoom</a></strong> have found that a .mixed salad. of various types of social proof is most effective.  The beauty of the web is you can test, learn and iterate quickly to find what works best.</p>
<p>To note, I don.t think a social proof strategy will be effective if you don.t start with a great product that delights customers, and that people like well enough to recommend.  How do you know if you have a great product?  Track organic traffic growth, reviews, ratings and repeat rates.  And measure your viral coefficient &#8211; if your site includes the ability to share, what percentage of your daily visitors and users share with others? How is the good word about your product being shared outside your site on the social web?  Do you know your Net Promoter Score, and your Klout score?</p>
<p>In the age of the social web, social proof is the new marketing.  If you have a great product waiting to be discovered, figure out how to build social proof around it by putting it in front of the right early influencers.  And, engineer your product to share the love.  Social proof is the best way for new users to learn why your product is great, and to remind existing users why they made a smart choice.</p>
<p><em>P.S.  FOMO, or the psychological phenomenon known as .Fear Of Missing Out,. is also a form of social proof.  As people are wired to learn from others, they are also wired to want things in short supply.  FOMO is a great forcing function on decision-making, as evidenced by the incredible growth of ecommerce flash sales. A friend at another venture firm has posted on his office wall .Is it FOMO, or is it real?. because it also happens in venture financings.  Maybe a topic for a future post.</em></p>

That's good news for the company, but maybe not good enough when you consider its overall traffic trajectory on Facebook, and its plans for an initial public offering as soon as next week.

After launching in the middle of November, the medieval role-playing simulation title has grown to <a href="http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/107040076067341-castleville">6.9 million daily active users</a> today, currently the third-highest out of any Zynga game on Facebook.

Overall, the developer has a total of <a href="http://appdata.com/devs/10-zynga">49.5 million</a> daily actives on Facebook, according to Inside Network's <a href="http://www.appdata.com">AppData</a> application tracking service. It's still by far the largest of any Facebook developer, but it has been falling from its peaks in previous months and years. Up until CastleVille launched, its games had been drifting down over the last 30 days from 48.2 million DAU.

And bigger picture, the company's Facebook DAU had been 59 million in the second quarter, and had already fallen to 54 million in the third. In previous amendments to its filing, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/04/zynga-q3-revenue-up-80-percent-to-306-8m-net-income-down-over-50-percent/">Zynga had said</a> these changes were due .to a decline in players of our more mature games and a limited number of new game launches in the first nine months of 2011..]]></description>

<p>After launching in the middle of November, the medieval role-playing simulation title has grown to <a href="http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/107040076067341-castleville">6.9 million daily active users</a> today, currently the third-highest out of any Zynga game on Facebook.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screen-shot-2011-11-27-at-10-47-05-am.png" rel="lightbox[458422]"></a></p>
<p>DAU is crucial because it indicates how addicted players are. This daily addiction is what leads some fraction of the players to buy virtual goods &#8212; the model that drives the social gaming business.</p>
<p>So, CastleVille has a lot of growing left to do if it&#8217;s going to bring back or replace all these former users. It&#8217;s certainly off to a good start.</p>
<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screen-shot-2011-11-27-at-10-59-46-am.png" rel="lightbox[458422]"></a></p>
<p>But by picking through the other 30-day AppData sets for Zynga&#8217;s other largest Facebook titles, you can see that most of its other games are declining. Zynga has had exceptional success at keeping its games popular with users over the months and years, but it is not immune from natural churn, nor from unsuccessful launches.</p>
<p>CityVille, its year-old city builder title and biggest game by DAU, has gone from 12.1 million <a href="http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/291549705119-cityville">to 10.8 million</a> in the past four weeks.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screen-shot-2011-11-27-at-10-52-31-am.png" rel="lightbox[458422]"></a></p>
<p>Its farming sim from 2009, FarmVille, is down by half a million, <a href="http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/102452128776-farmville">to 7 million today</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screen-shot-2011-11-27-at-10-54-15-am.png" rel="lightbox[458422]"></a></p>
<p>Texas Hold&#8217;Em, Zynga&#8217;s first hit (and an amazingly perennial one at that), has fallen below CastleVille, to <a href="http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/2389801228-texas-holdem-poker">6.3 million DAU</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screen-shot-2011-11-27-at-10-58-21-am.png" rel="lightbox[458422]"></a></p>
<p>Empires &amp; Allies, launched in June, has also <a href="http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/164285363593426-empires-allies">fallen by half a million</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screen-shot-2011-11-27-at-10-57-20-am.png" rel="lightbox[458422]"></a></p>
<p>Other new titles are also not looking too healthy. Adventure World, which launched in September, is <a href="http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/130479640376964-adventure-world-an-indiana-jones-game">down by almost one million DAU</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screen-shot-2011-11-27-at-11-17-10-am.png" rel="lightbox[458422]"></a></p>
<p>And Mafia Wars 2, the big new version of its long-standing RPG hit launched just last month, is now <a href="http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/121581087940710-mafia-wars">down by half</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screen-shot-2011-11-27-at-11-19-33-am.png" rel="lightbox[458422]"></a></p>
<p>CastleVille isn&#8217;t Zynga&#8217;s only success story now. The developer has been making big gains on mobile in the past year, culminating with an increase of more than a million DAU in October for an average total of 11.1 million DAU across iOS, Android and mobile web apps, as <a href="http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2011/11/18/zynga-11-1-million-daily-active-users-mobile-android-ios/">Inside Mobile Apps</a> spotted in the filings. That success has been led by Words With Friends, which has <a href="http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/168378113211268-words-with-friends">continued to grow</a> this month.</p>
<p><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screen-shot-2011-11-27-at-11-11-49-am.png" rel="lightbox[458422]"></a></p>
<p>CastleVille appears to be getting at least some resources that had been supporting other recent launches. Zynga has traditionally grown traffic through clever combinations of tactics including many smaller iterations within games, large-scale advertising on Facebook, aggressive use of Facebook&#8217;s social channels, and launches of new games and expansions that it can direct players to when they get tired of older games.</p>
<p>Regarding Mafia Wars and Adventure World&#8217;s especially distinct falls, Zynga has cut off recent launches before &#8212; like <a href="http://www.insidesocialgames.com/2010/03/25/zyngas-poker-blitz-launch-going-slower-affected-by-facebook-platform-issues/">for Poker Blitz</a>, which you&#8217;ve probably never heard of.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a more specific issue that Zynga faces with cross-promotion, that has mattered more and more as its players &#8212; mostly people who don&#8217;t consider themselves &#8220;gamers&#8221; &#8212; get more sophisticated. As my former colleague AJ Glasser observes in a great analysis piece over on <a href="http://www.insidesocialgames.com/2011/11/23/castleville-traffic-the-story-so-far/">Inside Social Games</a>, when people playing one game eventually get bored, they might not find a suitable replacement in Zynga&#8217;s stable.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s stakes are higher than ever, with ongoing rumors of its initial public offering pegging the date for as early as this coming week. Investors want a growth story. Zynga does have that in terms of revenue, as its recent filings show. It has been figuring out how to steadily make more money per user over the years.</p>
<p>But it also needs to show that it can keep gaining new users without losing too many old ones. CastleVille will need to show a strong growth streak over the next few months if it&#8217;s going to head into CityVille territory, and address its larger traffic concerns.</p>

It might be because we just threw the first iPhone photography conference, <a href="http://1197.is/" target="_blank">1197</a>, or because I allegedly run <a href="http://boltpeters.com/" target="_blank">a company</a> that studies and designs interfaces. It could also be the world of photography is changing so fast that lots of us nerds are talking about how a tool like Instagram can pass <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/instagram-hits-10-million-users-in-355-days-a-brief-retrospective/" target="_blank">10 million users in 355 days</a>. The interface implications are fascinating, the company and technology dynamics of serving content to 10 million users with less than ten employees are fascinating, the artistic content is fascinating, and the reasons why people like me are so addicted to the damn thing are fascinating. Here&#8217;s a crack at why, since I think some other attempts haven&#8217;t quite captured it.</p>
<p><strong>Quality</strong></p>
<p>The quality of camera phone images and filters, whether you love or hate them, is now relatively high.</p>
<p>Instagram came along and offered the same quality and visual appeal as <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hipstamatic/id342115564?mt=8">Hipstamatic</a> and other phone apps, but added a simple and well-designed interface to let you choose filters after the photo was taken. The quality of the end image, along with the physical iPhone camera, just hit a certain threshold of quality where the images became visually appealing. Even if you compare Instagram photos to professional Adobe Lightroom plug-ins, Photoshop Actions, and all the tricks and desktop software that photographers use, Instagram photos have a decent quality. The Instagram images are certainly not <em>comparable</em>, in terms of quality or resolution, duh, but the images are at least interesting.</p>
<p>Of course there are all sorts of drawbacks, most notably in resolution, but the quality is simply high enough to make iPhone users feel there is some artistic merit to their images. And sometimes there is. I.m not going to say how Instagram compares to film because I know film photographers who will slit my throat while I sleep. But the <a href="http://instagr.am/p/HA0YX/" target="_blank">image</a> above, for example, is from one of my favorite Instagram users, <a href="http://colerise.com/" target="_blank">Cole Rise</a>, who is the creator of the Rise filter. It shows how an iPhone photo can <em>approach</em> the same technical quality as a DSLR. Even the original Instagram interface had close attention to quality &#8211; it was simple but well-designed. I heard Tony Fadell (creator of <a href="http://www.nest.com/" target="_blank">Nest</a> and former iPod SVP) at <a href="http://brooklynbeta.org/" target="_blank">Brooklyn Beta</a> this year talk about the need for artistic passion in creating great technology experiences. Instagram delivers one of those great experiences because of their attention to quality in both the filters and the experience of posting photos. And yes, this whole section is a tribute to that crazy diatribe about .Quality. in <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>, but I digress.</p>
<p><strong>Audience</strong></p>
<p>It.s not just social, stupid.</p>
<p>So you have the nicer quality in Instagram, but so what? There are a bunch of apps that let you mess with iPhone photos.  The real clever part of Instagram is the audience component. Most articles tend to focus on the social or community aspect of the Instagram app, but labeling it a social networking tool is a mistake, because it.s not just social. It.s about having an audience for what you produce, and participating in an audience for other peoples. photos. Basically, the same rewarding experience that people get (got?) from Flickr is what makes Instagram popular, but with these three differences:</p>
<p><strong>Access.</strong> With popular or eccentric Instagram accounts, you get a peek into another world that isn&#8217;t quite possible with other services. If you want to only follow a circus security guard or a famous musician, you can do that through the intimacy of cell phone photos. You can also grant access to your close friends and family to share what you.re doing. It was the Community Manager at Instagram, <a href="https://twitter.com/%23!/jayzombie" target="_blank">Jessica Zollman</a>, who pointed out to me, &#8220;Instagram can be a window to places and things you don.t normally get to see,. (disclosure: Jessica is a friend and co-creator of <a href="http://1197.is/" target="_blank">1197</a>).</p>
<p>	<strong>Immediacy.</strong> You can get an immediate audience for your work. Plain and simple. If you.re a skilled photographer, handy with cats, pretty skies, or bikini tops, you can generate a fair amount of audience attention in a short time. This lets you put quick creative energy into photos and get them out to people in seconds. Knowing they.ll be be published instantly from the camera changes our approach to photos a little, and it.s attractive. Of course there is a ton of merit to the deliberate slow creation of photos, but we.re just looking at why people love Instagram, not whether it.s destroying the soul of photography. Let.s not go there. Besides, it.s not.</p>
<p>	<strong><a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/buttons.png" rel="lightbox[457530]"></a>Those little switches.</strong> Using the APIs from Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and other services, Instagram lets you share from one single screen. Brilliant. I had never seen photo-sharing across services stripped down so simply before. The sheer volume of Instagram tweets, before it even launched, generated a lot of curiosity. That was a big part of how the app got popular. And yes, there is a lot of hatred for Instagram photos pushed through to Facebook or Twitter, because some of us may over-share, but again, it expanded the popularity of the app rapidly.</p>
<p>On the flip side of the API game, it.s obvious that opening up their own platform so that thousands of sites and apps could use the Instagram API was a smart move. It.s a classic example of why <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/api-business-models-then-and-now/" target="_blank">the ol. API strategy</a> works so well. It.s worth noting that Instagram doesn.t let you upload with their API, and it strikes me as a deliberate and purposeful choice. They keep the service constrained to iPhone photos that way, or at least force you to transfer your SLR photo to your phone, you big faker, which brings us to the final point.</p>
<p><strong>Constraints</strong></p>
<p>It.s funny how hard it is to pick an interesting image from a giant grid on a web site. It.s also funny how many images we look at each day. What.s not funny is how much all that digital viewing numbs our senses and sucks our souls. I&#8217;m speaking in terms of science, of course. But when you display one image at a time in a series that&#8217;s essentially customized, based on time, something profound happens. More weight and significance is placed on each image, just because you have to consider it, at least for a split second, in your feed. <em>Instagram forces you to focus.</em></p>
<p>It might seem trivial, but showing one photo at a time is a design decision that creates more value for each image, and enhances your viewing experience. Plus it doesn&#8217;t hurt to have the images trapped inside a beautiful iPhone screen. It almost doesn.t matter who you follow.their photos probably look better one at a time. From a UX perspective, we keep learning that interfaces with constraints are successful, and it seems like such a straight-forward principle (140 characters, ahem), but it&#8217;s kind of worthless on it&#8217;s own. Obviously you can&#8217;t introduce constraints without other elements, which is why this is the last point. There.s something enticing about knowing that most Instagram photos are created on the iPhone, since it introduces a NASCAR-like equality. That makes it fun to see what other people can create with the same technical constraints you have. Photography has always been all about the equipment, and not at all about the equipment. Knowing millions of people are creating with roughly the same camera and app as you makes it exciting creatively. So constraints, combined with quality and an audience are what makes Instagram so addictive.</p>
<p><strong>The End Part</strong></p>
<p>Social apps have an ephemeral quality. We used to joke that sites like MySpace or Friendster were like night clubs. They are cool for a little while, but then people want to go somewhere else. Every once in a while, you have a club that endures, but it.s rare. Even my beloved Flickr seems a little deserted lately. So what will keep Instagram popular in the long haul? Probably staying committed to a great experience that excites them, which is likely what they.ve been doing, and maybe avoiding acquisition. Of course that might mean continuing to make people puzzle at why there are no official web or Android apps, but given their record of relatively few performance and stability issues, it seems like they have a pretty good handle on what impacts popularity. In the end, focus always wins.</p>

<p>Times have changed. The web and mobile <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/11/startup-ecosystems-take-time.html">startup ecosystem</a> of Silicon Valley has fully matured. Anyone can be an entrepreneur, and almost anyone can be an investor in startups. It previously required millions of dollars to fund a tech startup, and so they were mostly (now) big names in semi-established fields&#8211;Netscape, Google, Amazon, and PayPal, for starters. But this also sparked the Internet revolution. People interested in carving out their piece of this Internet revolution didn&#8217;t have many options, and so the talent pool centered around those big, multi-faceted names.</p>
<p>Venture captialists holding hundreds of millions of dollars held the sole responsibility of selecting those entrepreneurs that would lead the Internet revolution, since millions of dollars were needed for the most basic web infrastructure and to build an idea and achieve a product/market fit. Exits on these companies resulted in newly minted &#8220;tech&#8221; millionaires.</p>
<p>As the infrastructure of the Internet revolution was <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/05/technological-revolutions-and-financial-capital.html">built out</a>, the capital needs of smart new web companies reached toward zero. With capital needs lowered, but VCs still focused on large-scale investments and the resulting returns, angel investors (wealthy techies) started placing small bets, from their own wealth, on entrepreneurs. VCs lost their super status as super angels (like Dave McClure and Jeff Clavier), early-stage funds (including First Round Capital), and startup accelerators (such as TechStars and Y Combinator) gave entrepreneurs more access to smaller-scale capital, and more direct mentoring and personal investment. More startups got funded and found profitable exit strategies of their own, resulting in more millionaires, and then another bump in the number of angels.</p>
<p>Over time, that means that capital is no longer the primary competitive advantage for an investor. There are many, many more angel investors in the tech industry, writing checks to entrepreneurs they (hopefully) believe in. To Sean and Jim&#8217;s point, more people are starting their own startups instead of joining others, which is spreading out the talent pool in Silicon Valley and this flood of fresh capital is resulting in investor competition to invest in startups, resulting in higher valuations and <a href="http://cdixon.org/2011/07/28/the-downside-of-accelerated-investment-decisions/">speedier</a> funding <a href="http://redeye.firstround.com/2011/11/funfact1.html">cycles</a>. Early stage .Series A. valuations have surpassed the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/05/the-4-million-line/">$4 million line</a> and are now averaging in the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/24/were-in-the-middle-of-a-terrible-blubble/">$6 million &#8211; $8 million range</a>.</p>
<p>A lot has changed over just a few years and the market has simply corrected valuations, increasing the averages. As long as these increased valuations sustain themselves through exit, then everything still works for investors. The scary part for veteran investors is that they know there still remains a limited pool of buyers to achieve an exit &#8212; and building sustainable independent private companies doesn.t work for a VC.s business model. A VC fund.s limited partner investors are expecting a 10-year investment with a cash return, not ongoing future cash dividends. The industry needs more private market liquidity opportunities (secondary markets, private equity firms, etc).</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next in this cycle for Silicon Valley?</p>
<p>We.ll continue to see entrepreneurs and investors in Silicon Valley venturing into uncharted waters, where revenue models are an after-thought. The wide access to capital for entrepreneurs isn.t going away anytime soon, especially with a slew of tech IPOs on the horizon, which will create even more <a href="http://triangletechtalk.com/1/2011/11/the-rise-of-the-gentlemen-vc/">Gentlemen VCs</a>. Venture capitalists that invest full-time will begin further diversification of their funds outside of Silicon Valley and into other startup ecosystems, where capital for web and software-based startups isn.t as readily available.</p>
<p>Today it is easier and faster for entrepreneurs to build products and create value than it was just a few years ago. <a href="http://redeye.firstround.com/2011/11/fun-fact-of-the-week-path-to-revenues.html">Monetization platforms</a> (advertising technologies, mobile platforms, virtual currencies, etc) are in place that allow startups to generate revenue. The entire ecosystem (mentors, talent, technology, capital) supporting entrepreneurs and startups has matured. All of these factors have reduced investor risk compared to a few years ago. Even if that risk is lessened by only a few percentage points, this has created a funding model of higher valuations that can still work for the growing ranks of angel investors.</p>
<p>This isn.t stupid money flying around in the Valley. These new Angel investors are the product of 15 years of industry experience, and many cycles, some of them quite harsh. These new investors are bringing a wealth of experience, success, failure lessons, and connections. If they are committed to mentoring these new startups into building real businesses (and not gambling in hopes of picking the next <a href="http://www.stevepoland.com/startup-homeruns/">startup homerun</a>), then this class of internet revolutionaries will be well groomed to build the next generation of job-creating brand names.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to the <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/11100676368/heres-to-the-crazy-ones-the-first-of-apples">crazy ones</a>.</p>

<p>Like putting a <a HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUJbe5mls5Y">donk on it</a>, it seems like every new website needs to have a daily deal. Take <a HREF="http://curisma.com/">Curisma</a>, for example. On the surface it&#8217;s sort of an Oink-like website dedicated to the curation of cool products. Underneath, like a the cowbell in <i>Don&#8217;t Fear The Reaper</i>, is a <a HREF="http://curisma.com/site/deal">weekly deals site</a>. Luckily, the curation of Curisma is far more interesting than the deal, which just might save this start-up.</p>
<p>Founded by MIT students <a HREF="http://miter.mit.edu/user/273">Fatma Yalcin</a> and Eugene Gorelik, the site allows you to post stuff with a link to said stuff. Like watches? Post up a watch. Like a fancy lamp? Put that sucker up there. Presumably, over time, the database will burst at the seams, creating a Katamari-like wunderkammer. Right now it&#8217;s kind of barren.<br />
</p>
<p>The money is to come from sales through the site &#8211; hence the deals &#8211; and through affiliate sales with associated objects therein curated. There is also a rating system for folks to rise to the top of the curating ladder, allowing for the cream to rise to the top. </p>
<p>Does the world need another <a HREF="http://techcrunch.com/tag/Oink">Oink</a> (or <a HREF="http://techcrunch.com/tag/Blippy">Blippy</a>, for that matter?)? I&#8217;m going to withhold my judgement, but the design here is clean and clever and I could see the potential value to folks looking for a clever gift for the man or woman who has everything.</p>

<p><a href="http://bu.mp/">Bump</a> co-founder, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/david-lieb">David Lieb</a> launched an app that&#8217;s secured roughly <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/bump-technologies">$20 million in funding</a> and has been downloaded approximately <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/25/founder-stories-bump-david-lieb-60-million-downloads/">60-million times</a>. In his final Founder Stories interview with host Chris Dixon, Lieb predicts the next hot sector, discusses hiring employees and dishes out advice for future founders.</p>
<p>When asked by Dixon to name his favorite &#8220;mobile apps&#8221; Lieb responds he is a big fan of &#8220;realtime information&#8221; and lists Twitter and Facebook as top picks. He continues by saying that approximately &#8220;5 billon&#8221; smartphones are expected to be in service within the next few years and believes that, &#8220;the next wave of really important companies will be mobile first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later in the interview Lieb tells Dixon that hiring talent hasn&#8217;t been an issue for his team and admits that while some workers may have gotten away, &#8220;It turns out the people you really want to hire, find you.&#8221; He wraps by saying that he&#8217;s seen too many founders suffer from &#8220;analysis paralysis&#8221; and urges entrepreneurs to &#8220;stop thinking and just go build it.&#8221; Recognizing that if his team had overanalyzed Bump, it never would have gotten off the ground.</p>
<p>Make sure to watch the entire interview for additional insights, including Lieb&#8217;s take on how founders can help separate themselves from the pack.</p>

Founded in 2008, Cotendo has raised <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/cotendo">over $36 million</a> in funding from investors like Sequoia Capital, Benchmark Capital and Tenaya Capital.</p>
<p>A few months ago, Cotendo <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/15/cloud-technology-startup-cotendo-raises-17-million-from-citrix-juniper-vcs/">raised $17 million</a> in new funding from its previous backers, with Citrix Systems and Juniper Networks stepping in as strategic investors as well. Other strategic partners include Google, AT&amp;T and Sumitomo Corporation.</p>
<p>The company specializes in acceleration services for dynamic Web apps, static and dynamic web content, performance monitoring and automatic failover as well as real-time reporting and analytics. Obviously, Akamai also provides such services to its clients, but is much bigger than Cotendo.</p>
<p>On an interesting sidenote: a year ago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology joined <a href="http://blog.streamingmedia.com/the_business_of_online_vi/2010/11/akamai-files-patent-infringement-lawsuit-against-cotendo.html">Akamai in suing Cotendo</a> over patent infringement.</p>
<p>Cotendo is headquartered in Silicon Valley with R&amp;D facilities near Netanya, in Israel. Its <a href="http://www.cotendo.com/executive/">three co-founders</a> are Commtouch Software veterans.</p>
<p>According to Globes, Cotendo customers include Zynga, Vistaprint and Facebook. The company&#8217;s advisory board includes <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jonathan-heiliger">Jonathan Heiliger</a>, currently VP of Technical Operations at Facebook.</p>

Things aren't yet quite as dire as the last time the economy tailspinned into recession, but a number of factors are making some startup investors wary.

Many VCs (and founders) have been feasting, and now it might be time to take  a breather.

And whether you consider this a Series A Crunch or <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/09/bullshit-series-a-crunch/">not</a>, many more seed stage companies got funded over the past 18 months than previously and many more will subsequently not continue to get funded when it comes time for a series A.]]></description>

His pace of investing has not slowed down.  He&#8217;s just being realistic.</p>
<p>Speaking to other early-stage investors recently, I get the same sense that the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/10/founder-stories-fred-wilson-frothy-valuations/">froth</a> (dare I say &#8220;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/on-bubbles-and-why-it-will-all-be-fine/">bubble</a>&#8220;?) of the past 18 months is coming to an end. Many VCs (and founders) have been feasting, and now it might be time to take  a breather. The number of seed-stage fundings is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/09/crunchcrunch/">outpacing</a> series A fundings. And whether you consider this a Series A Crunch or <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/09/bullshit-series-a-crunch/">not</a>, many more seed stage companies got funded over the past 18 months than previously and many more will subsequently not continue to get funded when it comes time for a series A.</p>
<p>Many of the top-tier VC firms who have been scrambling to get into as many seed deals as possible, are now being extra cautious and selective. When a big-name VC declines to invest again a second time around that sends a negative signal to the other potential investors and can often kill a deal. I am starting to hear stories of exactly that happening. At the same time, VCs are fighting each other more fiercely than ever to get into the top deals and will pay whatever the price.</p>
<p>Yet, on the larger economic front, things don&#8217;t look so rosy. Overall economic <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/business/economy/us-economic-growth-is-revised-to-2-0-percent.html">growth remains sluggish</a> at (a recently downward-revised) 2 percent last quarter, unemployment remains at a very high 9 percent, and governments around the world (including the U.S.) are in the throes of major debt and deficit crises. Both consumer and enterprise spending on technology is directly tied to the economy.</p>
<p>Kopelman is right.  It&#8217;s not R.I.P Good Times quite yet, but be prepared to see some bloodletting. The easy money might not be so easy anymore and the economy is still limping along. A shakeout isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing. It means less competition for those who survive and it forces them to find their business model faster. If you look back at companies that were founded in 2008, they include Airbnb, Groupon, and ngmoco.</p>

He's had his ups and downs - what, for example, was the deal with <em>Paper Mario</em>? And <em>Super Mario Strikers</em> was pretty hard to love - but darn it if the little guy doesn't keep coming back for more and keeps you, at the very least, entertained.

<em>Super Mario 3D Land</em> is the latest in the Mario saga. The story is fairly typical - something was stolen (a lot of leaves) and Bowser took Princess Peach. Your mission is to find the leaves (which are special and give you the Tanooki suit) and then find Peach. What you go through to find her, however, is where all of the fun comes in.

<p><em>Super Mario 3D Land</em> is the latest in the Mario saga. The story is fairly typical &#8211; something was stolen (a lot of leaves) and Bowser took Princess Peach. Your mission is to find the leaves (which are special and give you the Tanooki suit) and then find Peach. What you go through to find her, however, is where all of the fun comes in.</p>
<p>The game is a 2D platformer turned 3D. You move swiftly through a nicely rendered 3D land and hop, stomp, and jump on enemies and into question blocks. Initially gameplay is a bit stiff and weird but once you realize you&#8217;re actually following a nicely and cleverly set path through this 3D world you can loosen up and explore a bit. </p>
<p>Mario has existed in 3D before, most strikingly in in <em>Super Mario 64</em>. This game has very little to do with that title and is instead a fully-formed platformer in 3D. It is more on par with <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i> in terms of gameplay and mechanics and it&#8217;s clear the 3D Land is a Galaxy title reduced in scope and, obviously, space flight. </p>
<p>Now for the million-dollar question: how is the 3D on the 3DS? The problem with the 3DS is you often lose the 3D sweet spot while heavily into gameplay. This problem is quite pronounced in action titles like <i>Starfox</i> and less prevalent in SM3DL. However, it was a bit frustrating and I often resorted to turning 3D off while playing. Does this mean the 3D doesn&#8217;t work? No, but it wasn&#8217;t quite to my taste.</p>
<p>The game itself offers excellent playability and the <a HREF="http://kotaku.com/5857455/this-is-what-happens-if-you-stink-at-super-mario-3d-land">&#8220;help&#8221; system</a>, namely a super leaf that essentially allows you to breeze through the level unharmed by enemies and with a flying Tanooki suit, makes it great for novices. The help system kicks in after two deaths &#8211; it gives you a power-up &#8211; and then when you die five times it gives you the special leaf. Basically it helps reduce the frustration for casual gamers.</p>
<p>This is a Mario game. Mario is great. Is it worth buying a 3DS over? Probably not unless you&#8217;re also a Zelda fan as <i>Ocarina of Time</i> is superb on this device. However with the launch of the equally superb <i>Mario Kart 7</i>, Nintendo does offer some compelling reasons to pick up their console &#8211; and this game &#8211; for the holidays.</p>

It was fitting, as Pinterest was born two years ago on Thanksgiving day 2009.  Ben had been working on a website with a few friends, and his girlfriend came up with the name while they were watching TV. Pinterest officially launched to the world 4 months later.

Some startups go crazy with hype and users right after launch. And some don.t. I don.t know the founders, but I thought I.d take apart Pinterest.s story to discuss growth and virality in consumer web startups. Pinterest was not an overnight success. On the contrary, its growth was surprisingly modest after Turkey Day 2009.

Take a look at <a href="http://siteanalytics.compete.com/pinterest.com/">Pinterest.s one-year traffic on Compete</a> from Oct 2010 to Oct 2011, which is the picture in this post, and shows Pinterest rising from 40,000 to 3.2 million monthly unique visitors. I took both ends of this chart and estimated monthly compounded growth over Pinterest.s lifetime, then interpolated the curve using constant growth and put the results in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?pli=1&#38;key=0ApuaWa5LyPnkdExFRlh1YzVvdHUtQUp4RDZUZExKZnc&#38;hl=en_US#gid=0">this Google Spreadsheet</a>.]]></description>

<p>Some startups go crazy with hype and users right after launch. And some don.t. I don.t know the founders, but I thought I.d take apart Pinterest.s story to discuss growth and virality in consumer web startups. Pinterest was not an overnight success. On the contrary, its growth was surprisingly modest after Turkey Day 2009.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="http://siteanalytics.compete.com/pinterest.com/">Pinterest.s one-year traffic on Compete</a> from Oct 2010 to Oct 2011, which is the picture in this post, and shows Pinterest rising from 40,000 to 3.2 million monthly unique visitors.

<p>Backing out of Compete.s numbers, we see Pinterest grew about 50% month over month from a base of zero since its inception (on average, smoothing the curve). Today growth is catching fire, as evidenced by the near doubling of traffic last month, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/22/pinterest-pageviews-etsy-grew-2000/">Pinterest.s page views growing 20X since June</a>, according to comScore.</p>
<p>Note these numbers are approximations and also do not count the significant traffic the service sees from mobile (Pinterest.s app currently takes the #6 social spot in the iTunes store). Also my guess is that a lot of its unique visitors arrive out of network (from Facebook / Twitter), and many of these uniques leave Pinterest without registering (more on this below) so it.s tough to know their exact user numbers.</p>
<p>But let.s play pretend and use the data we have to do some projections on where Pinterest could be a year from today.  Its recent VCs certainly did this, and decided to give the startup a $200M+ valuation.  Ron Conway said recently that Pinterest is growing like Facebook did in 2006. Facebook actually <a href="http://www.bizreport.com/2007/11/facebook_shows_125_growth_year_over_year.html">grew from 14 million uniques to 26 million uniques</a> from May 2006 to May 2007, then a year and half later they had <a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2008/12/16/facebook-now-growing-by-over-600000-users-a-day-and-new-engagement-stats/">rocketed to 140 million uniques</a>, and were growing at about 20 million uniques per month. So monthly growth early on for Facebook was around 10-15%.</p>
<p>Can Pinterest really sustain its wild 45% monthly growth? No, unless it.s destined to be the fastest growing startup in history. However, we can be pretty sure Pinterest has hit a tipping point. their page view numbers are simply insane. If they were to grow 20% month/month over the next year, Pinterest would be at 30 million uniques a year from today. And with 25% month/month growth, they.d be at 50 million.  These are pure guesses, but Ron.s statements and last month.s growth make this look possible, so let.s examine virality and Pinterest.s underlying fundamentals.</p>
<p><strong>Virality . Does My Startup Really Need It?</strong></p>
<p>Viral sharing is typically emphasized in products or services where the cost to acquire a customer needs to be low, and you can.t afford to spend money on paid channels, like Mint.com did, or like a Living Social / Groupon.  Having a free method, ideally a user-driven method, is critical to consumer web startups.</p>
<p>But there.s a lot of confusion around virality. The reality is that you can build a sustainable business without .going viral. and this point is not understood well among techies or investors. The connotation .going viral. typically means having a viral growth coefficient of greater than 1. For every user that comes on your platform, he or she refers 1 additional user. This ensures a service will .hockey stick..</p>
<p>But what if every user only refers, say 0.2 new users? Contrary to popular belief, this can also lead to a sustainable business. However, the lack of pure virality implies that you absolutely must retain existing users to grow. This is why daily active users and monthly active users are such important metrics, and are tracked maniacally by CEOs and investors. Churn is your ultimate enemy. Sure, it will take longer to grow if each user brings in fewer new people, but as long as most users don.t leave, you.re all good.</p>
<p>Viral cycle times also factor in . the shorter the .referrer. period, the faster the virality takes hold . for example, if a user invites 1 new user every month, that.s better than if she invites 1 per year. Social games like Zynga historically have extremely short viral cycles; however they must, because churn is extremely high (user lifetime is often measured in hours or days, because users get bored with games quickly and move on).</p>
<p>Obviously, the more viral a service, the more sustainable it is, but it.s really in the details. And overnight success is not a guarantee for sustainability. Many startups are pushing way too prematurely on press before they.ve demonstrated real sustainability. I see this all the time and Eric Ries covered this in his discussion on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/11/are-you-building-the-right-product/">the danger of vanity metrics</a>.</p>
<p>The truth is that startups often draft off of artificial success that originates simply from hype within the tech echo-chamber. Some sites go from 0 to 100K+ visitors in weeks and people high five one other, then look around and say .what.s next,  how do we keep these users happy?.</p>
<p><strong>Pinterest.s Virality and Sharing Examined</strong></p>
<p>Pinterest.s story is much different . they didn.t have the same early .hype spikes. as many other startups do, standing at only 40K uniques 8 months after launch! It took Pinterest quite a while for a network-effect to take hold. Clearly every startup should hope for early virality. But if it doesn.t exist initially, you must work to perfect a soft onboarding of virality that.s based on high engagement, and create a product that people love and will come back to, while layering viral techniques on top of that.</p>
<p>Today, Pinterest is clearly insanely addictive among its user base, and they are sharing.  But one reason I see Pinterest as a valuable a case study is precisely because they didn.t experience the early adopter .hype. spike 18 months ago. Like many tech startups, I am sure some content was seeded within the tech community by the founders. But their .normal. user was a housewife in the Midwest, not a techie reading TechCrunch or Hacker News. And I.m sure Pinterest made a bunch of product tweaks early on to iterate around sharing and engagement, as virality took hold.</p>
<p>Let.s compare Pinterest to Instagram for a minute, since both base off of photo content as their primary unit. Instagram has actually done nearly all its user acquisition virally out of network (sharing to Facebook and Twitter) and via word of mouth, with limited sharing in the network. This is remarkable when you think about it.  By that I mean that there.s no real sharing inside the network other than liked photos surfacing due to popularity, and manual discovery via hashtags. There is no .regram. if you will. You also can.t follow people or like a photo from Instagram without an iPhone (even if it.s tweeted or posted to the web!) unless you.re a power user on an API mashup (see <a href="http://inkstagram.com/">Inkstagram</a>). All this reveals just how impressive Instagram.s growth has been, as they went from about 1 million to 10 million users over the past year.</p>
<p>Being realistic, Pinterest could have much higher growth than Instagram based on the fact that it.s unconstrained as a platform . it works from web, mobile web, in-app, and has easier baked-in virality around sharing. .Pinning. has this built in because many initial pins start as .repins. of other people.s content. In this way, existing content will often be the seed for a new user.s stream. The pin unit is genius.</p>
<p>Users can also visit the Pinterest site and participate (i.e. browse endlessly) before signing up. This allows full consumptive access before registering and is a secret weapon if done right. Fred Wilson discussed this recently in his post about the <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/09/the-logged-out-user-continued.html">logged out user</a>, giving an example of his mom checking his tweet stream without logging into Twitter . she gets value out of the service while ironically <em>bringing down</em> Twitter.s monthly active user metric. Similar value can be granted to consumptive users who visit the site but don.t initially register.</p>
<p>Then when a user is ready to pin content, they create an account and go wild . Pinterest leverages web content from Tumblr like no site that has ever existed, thus riding on top of its network-effect while not requiring user generated content like many services. They.ve also perfected in-network virality (pin, repin, like) in addition to out of network sharing (Facebook, Twitter) to grow virally. For these reasons Pinterest could conceivably grow as fast as any consumer service we have seen in recent memory. It.s fun to speculate on all this when you factor in Ron Conway.s statements comparing growth to Facebook.s early heydays.</p>
<p>And perhaps most notably, though it will surely take a while, Pinterest is already threatening to monetize, as those Midwest housewives are literally <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/06/rise-pinterest-shift-search-discovery/">using it for shopping discovery</a>, which Pinterest can profit off of by taking attribution for purchases that originate off its platform. I know several friends who.ve purchased stuff spontaneously via random discovery on the site. I expect Pinterest to be thriving a year from now (my guess is 30 million users next Thanksgiving) and also spawn hundreds of copycat startups in other verticals (.Pinterest for that.). Sadly, many of these will arrive on TechCrunch and spike in hype, then fail to nail any true virality before they are slowly forgotten&#8230; After all, this is the cycle of consumer startups.</p>

In part II of his Founder Stories interview, Lieb notes there is bigger picture at play than just swapping content. He tells host, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dixon">Chris Dixon</a>, "there is a lot of time spent figuring out how I interface with this [smartphone] to go access the virtual world, but nobody has really spent a lot of time thinking, well I am using this phone in the real world, what do I want to do in the real world, and how do I want to interact with other people and things in the real world, and that is the problem that we want to solve, we want to build that new UI layer for the real world."]]></description>

<p>Seeking a way to reduce friction while exchanging contact information, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/david-lieb">David Lieb</a> and his two co-founders launched <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/bump-technologies">Bump</a> &#8211; a service that allows users to swap everything from calendar events to music samples by simply tapping their smartphones together.</p>
<p>In part II of his Founder Stories interview with host <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dixon">Chris Dixon</a>, Lieb tells Dixon the big picture plan. &#8220;There is a lot of time spent figuring out how I interface with this [smartphone] to go access the virtual world, but nobody has really spent a lot of time thinking &#8230; how do I want to interact with other people and things in the real world, and that is the problem that we want to solve, we want to build that new UI layer for the real world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prior to making this point, Lieb and Dixon discuss Bump&#8217;s decision to allow companies like PayPal (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/18/bump-iphone-api/">and hundreds of others</a>) to embed its code into their apps. While this would seem to be a big opportunity for Bump, Lieb notes, &#8220;as it turns out, our growth has been so rapid that our app just dwarfs any of these other apps that use our API.&#8221; Regarding PayPal specifically, Lieb says, &#8220;last time I checked I think there were like 10-million installs, maybe, so we have 6-times that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helping Bump hit that 60-million mark were Sequoia Capital who led a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/24/sequoia-capital-invests-in-bump-technologies-the-iphone-tapping-data-swap-app/">Series A</a> round and Andreessen Horowitz who led a $16 million <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/10/bump-raises-16-million-round-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">Series B</a> round.</p>
<p>Having steered the company though such growth, Lieb says managing emotions is still a bit tricky. &#8220;There are definitely days where I am like wow, we are just killing it, this is awesome and then 18 hours later, someone says something or we get some new information and we are like, ah man, we are totally screwed, and usually the answer is somewhere in the middle.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Monday">Cyber Monday</a> was coined in 2005, the Monday after Thanksgiving was the 12<sup>th</sup> biggest online shopping day of the year. That year, Facebook had 5.5 million users and Twitter didn.t exist. <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2010/12/Billion_Dollar_Bonanza_Cyber_Monday_Surpasses_1_Billion_in_U.S._Spending">In 2010, Cyber Monday was the #1 biggest online shopping day of the year</a>, with sales topping $1 billion. I believe the growth of social media and the importance of Cyber Monday are correlated because peer -to-peer sharing of deals and owned marketing channels like Facebook Pages and Twitter accounts are bringing promotions directly to where users spend their time online.</p>
<p>The red line is where Cyber Monday ranked among the top online shopping days (from comScore press releases) for that year. Aside from 2008, which is an outlier due the recession, there is a trend in Cyber Monday popularity growing along with Facebook users.</p>
<p>As background, Cyber Monday was coined in 2005 by e-commerce industry group Shop.org while I was its executive director. The trend was identified through data from online retailers who in in previous years had seen spikes in sales the Monday after Thanksgiving. It seems that people go online to continue their post-Black Friday shopping for items they didn.t buy, perhaps because they wanted to research them more thoroughly or buy them out of the sight of the intended recipient.</p>
<p>There is an argument about the impact of social media on retail sales. Some are skeptical, saying <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/04/07/facebook-wont-become-e-commerce-force-analyst-says/">social isn.t as effective</a> as email marketing or paid search advertising for customer acquisition. Others think the <a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2011/04/07/potential-of-social-ecommerce/">shift to social advertisements and viral marketing is just starting to take off</a>. The debate will surely continue as researchers struggle to identify the perfect science for measuring its effect. Ironically, data about the impact of TV and radio ads remains just as elusive, yet broadcast advertising continues to command a disproportionate amount of spending.</p>
<p>But retailers are successfully building their presences on social networks. <a href="http://www.facebookcommercestrategies.com/2011/11/october-2011-channeladvisor-facebook-commerce-index.html">The 25 U.S. retailers with the most fans on Facebook had a combined 259 million fans</a> in October. During the holiday season, these fans will find deals from retailers who.ve invested in social. Retailers hesitant about social will be less likely to attain sales from these users as their competitors profit.</p>
<p>According to Shop.org, <a href="http://www.nrf.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;op=viewlive&amp;sp_id=1227">29 percent of consumers will check out a retailer.s Facebook page</a> as part of their online holiday shopping this year.  Of course, these are just the people who say they.ll seek out this information and it doesn.t take into account the number of people that will see sales and promotions from retailers in their news feed.</p>
<p>Data aside, there is no question that social media is having a profound impact on the way we shop. Today, we depend on our social networks to tip us off to the best deals and sales. Only two or three years ago this was not the case.</p>
