What is Cloreader ?
Cloreader is a talking news reader which can take voice commands to control the flow of the news articles and the way they are read.

Cloreader Service is the supporting back end module that fetches news articles from different channels and provides a combined feed over an API. the Cloreader Android App will consume these APIs to know what would be the next article to play.
